# 🗓️ Day 2 – Conditions and Loops in Python

## 📚 Topics I Learned
- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements  
- Comparison and logical operators  
- `for` loops and `while` loops  
- Using `range()` function  

---

## 💻 Code Practice

### 🧩 Example 1 – If-Else
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Number:", i)
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1

🧠 What I Learned Today
How conditional logic controls the program flow
How loops help repeat code automatically
Difference between for and while loops

🧩 Challenges I Faced
Forgetting indentation after if and for statements
Mixing up < and <= in conditions

**Commit message:** `Added Day 2 - Conditions and Loops`
